				<h2>View Transitions API Browser Support</h2>
				<p class="date">November 14, 2025</p>

				<p>As with any modern web API, browser support for View Transitions is an
					important consideration when deciding whether to implement them in your
					project. The good news is that support is growing rapidly, and the API
					is designed with progressive enhancement in mind.</p>

				<p>Chrome and Edge have full support for the View Transitions API. Safari
					and Firefox are actively working on implementations. Even without
					universal support, the API gracefully degrades - if a browser doesn't
					support view transitions, users simply won't see the animations, but
					the site will function normally.</p>

				<p>This progressive enhancement approach means you can start using view
					transitions today without worrying about breaking your site for users
					on older browsers. The experience will simply be enhanced for users
					with modern browsers.</p>

				<p>For critical applications where you need consistent behavior across
					all browsers, you can detect support using JavaScript and provide
					alternative animations, though this somewhat defeats the purpose of
					using the native API.</p>
