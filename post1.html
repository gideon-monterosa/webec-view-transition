				<h2>Understanding CSS View Transitions</h2>
				<p class="date">November 16, 2025</p>

				<p>CSS View Transitions represent a paradigm shift in how we approach
					page transitions and animations on the web. Instead of relying on
					complex JavaScript libraries or manual DOM manipulation, the View
					Transitions API provides a native, performant way to create smooth
					transitions between different states of your application.</p>

				<p>The API works by capturing snapshots of the old and new states of your
					page, then automatically animating between them. This creates a
					seamless visual experience that feels more like a native application
					than a traditional web page.</p>

				<p>To enable view transitions, you simply need to add the
					<code>view-transition</code>
					meta tag to your HTML and use standard
					navigation. The browser handles the rest, creating smooth fade
					transitions by default.</p>

				<p>The beauty of this approach is its simplicity. With minimal code, you
					can create experiences that previously required hundreds of lines of
					JavaScript and careful state management.</p>
