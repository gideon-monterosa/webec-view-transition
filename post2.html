				<h2>Advanced View Transition Patterns</h2>
				<p class="date">November 15, 2025</p>

				<p>Once you understand the basics of CSS View Transitions, you can explore
					more advanced patterns that create truly stunning user experiences.
					These patterns leverage the full power of the API to create custom
					animations that match your application's unique design language.</p>

				<p>One powerful technique is using view transition names to create shared
					element transitions. By giving elements on different pages the same
					transition name, you can create morphing animations where an element
					appears to move and transform between pages.</p>

				<p>Another advanced pattern involves customizing the transition animation
					itself. While the default cross-fade is elegant, you can use CSS
					animations to create slides, zooms, or any other transition effect you
					can imagine.</p>

				<p>The key to successful view transitions is understanding when to use
					them. Not every navigation needs a fancy animation - sometimes a simple
					fade is more appropriate. The goal is to enhance the user experience,
					not distract from it.</p>
